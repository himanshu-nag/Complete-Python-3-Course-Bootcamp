#Chapter 3 - Casting
#In this tutorial we'll be learning about casting

#previously we learned how to assign datatype to a variable

x = float(7.0)

#now lets cast a float to an integer

a = 7.0
b = int(a)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))

print(a)
print(b)

#now lets cast string in to int
a = "7"

b = int(a)

print(type(b))

#let's perform mathematical operator

c = 8
print(b+c)
