#Chapter 2 - Variables
#In this tutorial, we'll learn about Variables and assigning values to a Variable
#Variable can be directly implemented without any data type
#Example


a = 5
print(a)

#strings can be assigned using ""

b = "Hello World"
print(b)

#Let's try what happens when we try to print a string variable and an integer variable

a = 5
b = "Hello World"
print(a+b)

#it gives an error stating operator can perform with different data types
#Let's try a different method

a = 5
b = "Hello World"

print(a,b)
